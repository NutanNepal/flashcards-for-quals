# flashcards-for-me
 minimalistic flashcard app to study math topics - algebra, analysis, topology etc

# issues: 
    clicking listitems in fragments refreshes the page; because of new activity?;

    webview content loads very slow; the app feels clunky because of that;

    is it ok to parse the xml everytime? another way to handle the data?;

    is one xml with all the data good or multiple xml for each item?;

    or is there another way to group the flashcards?;

    adding new flashcards from the app itself;

    theme switch button not yet implemented. would like to move it to the bottom of the navigation drawer;

    move settings to the side of/under the theme switch;
